# Predicting house model
# Overview
The report will focus on building a predictive model for USA sales Prices. There is a total of 32 variables, including target variables and Sale price, ranging from different housing features.Â After understanding different input variables and carrying out data preparation processes, two different models, regression and decision tree models, will be developed and compared together for the most appropriate model.

# Key skills demonstrated
**1. R programming language:** Using R studio with R language to perform data analysis
**2. Data Cleaning and Mining:** Handling missing data, dealing with outliers, and normalizing data. 
**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying trends, patterns, and relationships in data
**4. Predictive analytics:** Building different predictive models, including Regression model and Decision trees and decide the best models to predict the house prices

# Project setup
To run this project, you will need R Studio to run the code to obtain the desired data and save your data in the correct directory 

# Project structure
1. Dataset: The data to be used during the analytics process
2. Predicting house code: The file includes all the code lines to be used for extracting information from the Cleaning and Mining process to Building and Choosing the appropriate model

# How to run the project 
The project performs in order of 3 following stages
1. Cleaning and Mining:
   * Transform the data to the appropriate format
   * Checking the duplicates and missing values
   * Dealing with skewed data
   * Learning the pattern of predictor variable and its correlation with target variable
2. Building models
   * Building 4 regression models to choose the optimal one
   * Building 3 decision tree models to choose the optimal one
3. Choosing the most optimal model
   Compare regression model with decision tree models to decide on the most suitable model for predicting house prices

The code file has been organized according to the above stages.
