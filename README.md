# Predicting house model
# Overview
The report will focus on building a predictive model for Sales Prices in the USA. There is a total of 32 variables, including target variables and Sale price, ranging from different housing features.Â After understanding different input variables and carrying out data preparation processes, two different models, regression and decision tree models, will be developed and compared together for the most appropriate model.
